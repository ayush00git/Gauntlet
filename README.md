ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement 27 â€“ Herbs Geotagging

Domain: Agriculture / Clean & Green Tech
Type: Software

ðŸ”¹ What It Means

The challenge is to build a system (app + platform) that can:

Geotag herbs â€“ record the exact GPS location where medicinal herbs/plants are found or cultivated.

Database creation â€“ maintain details like:

Herb species

Location (latitude/longitude)

Growth conditions (soil, climate, altitude)

Photographic evidence (images of the herb)

Visualization â€“ show this data on a map for research, conservation, and commercial purposes.

ðŸ”¹ Why Itâ€™s Needed

India has a rich diversity of medicinal herbs but no centralized geospatial record.

Helps Ayush / pharma industries in sourcing authentic herbs.

Supports farmers and conservationists by preventing overharvesting and illegal trade.

Enables scientific research on regional distribution of herbs.

ðŸ”¹ Tech Involvement

Web/Mobile app for field data collection (farmers, researchers can upload info).

Geotagging via GPS (mobile device sensors).

AI/ML (optional add-on):

Herb identification from images (using computer vision).

Predicting suitable regions for specific herbs based on climate/soil data.

Dashboard:

Map-based visualization (Google Maps / Mapbox).

Search & filter herbs by region, type, or medicinal use.

ðŸ”¹ Example Flow

A farmer in Himachal finds a rare medicinal herb.

Using the app, he clicks a photo â†’ AI model identifies it as Ashwagandha.

GPS coordinates get attached automatically.

Data uploads to the central system â†’ visible on a dashboard map for researchers & authorities.
